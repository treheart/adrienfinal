# Limora AI — Results

## Result A — Asset hunting is killing your time

The #1 thing slowing down your projects is:

❌ ASSET FRAGMENTATION

You're juggling stock image sites, icon libraries, Figma community files, and generic AI tools. Every project means searching five different platforms, and half of what you find doesn't even fit. This is unbillable time that adds up fast.

**The Fix**

Limora is an AI powered asset engine built specifically for web designers. Generate hero backgrounds, icons, illustrations, product photos, and mockups from one single place. No more platform hopping. No more settling for "close enough." Just production-ready assets in minutes.

## Result B — AI outputs aren't usable

The #1 thing wasting your creative energy is:

❌ PROMPT ENGINEERING

Generic AI image tools require endless prompt tweaking to get anything usable. The outputs look "AI-generated" — fine for art, useless for UI. You spend more time fighting the tool than designing.

**The Fix**

Limora replaces blank prompts with guided inputs. Tell it your colors, what should be shown, and your visual style. It handles the rest. Outputs are designed for websites — not art galleries. Fast iteration, predictable results, no prompt engineering required.
